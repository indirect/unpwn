# Unpwn

A gem to help you make sure that passwords are good, and not likely to be guessed or hacked, as suggested by [NIST SP-800-63B](https://pages.nist.gov/800-63-3/).

Unpwn checks passwords locally against the top one million passwords, as provided by the [nbp](https://cry.github.io/nbp/) project. Then, it uses the [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com) API to check proposed passwords against the largest corpus of publicly dumped passwords in the world.

Inspired by @codahale's [passpol](https://github.com/codahale/passpol), and uses prior work from [nbp](https://cry.github.io/nbp/) and [devise-pwned\_password](https://github.com/michaelbanfield/devise-pwned_password).

## Installation

Run `bundle add unpwn` to add the gem to your `Gemfile`.

## Usage (Rails)

```ruby

  validates :password, unpwned: true, if: -> { Rails.env.production? }
end

## Usage (Ruby)

# Default length requirement is 8 characters minimum, no maximum
Unpwn.acceptable?("abc123") # => false
# Min and max can be set manually, but only as low as 8 and 64 respectively.
Unpwn.new(min: 10, max: 64).acceptable?("visit raven follow disk") # => true
```
